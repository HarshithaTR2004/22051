        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinating the Chicken:</li>
            <p>In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</p>
            
            <li>Cooking Biryani Rice:</li>
            <p>Wash the Basmati rice thoroughly and soak it for 30 minutes.</p>
            <p>In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice, green cardamom, bay leaf, cinnamon stick, and salt. Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (it should still have a bite). Drain and set aside.</p>
            
            <li>Preparing Biryani Masala:</li>
            <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the oil or ghee.</p>
            <p>Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter.</p>
            <p>Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown.</p>
            <p>Add the green chilies, chopped tomatoes, and cook until the tomatoes are soft and oil starts to separate.</p>
            <p>Add red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook for a few minutes.</p>
            
            <li>Layering and Dum Cooking:</li>
            <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, spread a layer of cooked rice.</p>
            <p>Add a layer of the marinated chicken.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle chopped mint and cilantro over the chicken.</p>
            <p>Repeat the layers until all the rice and chicken are used up.</p>
            <p>Drizzle saffron milk over the top, garnish with fried onions, and drizzle ghee.</p>
            <p>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal the edges with dough.</p>
            <p>Cook on low heat (dum cooking) for 20-25 minutes until the chicken is cooked, and the flavors meld.</p>
            <p>Once done, fluff the biryani gently with a fork and serve hot.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>Chicken Biryani is best enjoyed with raita or a side salad. Enjoy your homemade Chicken Biryani!</p>
