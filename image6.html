        <img src="image6.jpg" alt="Idli" width="400" height="400">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups idli rice or parboiled rice</li>
            <li>1 cup urad dal (black gram)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately and soak them in water for 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>Grind the soaked rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds together into a smooth batter. Add water as needed while grinding.</li>
            <li>Transfer the batter to a large bowl and add salt. Mix well and let it ferment for 8-10 hours or overnight. The batter will rise and become slightly fluffy.</li>
            <li>If desired, add baking soda to the batter and mix well. This is optional but can make the idlis fluffier.</li>
            <li>Grease the idli molds or plates with oil or ghee.</li>
            <li>Pour a ladleful of the batter into each mold and steam the idlis for about 10-12 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the idlis to cool slightly before removing them from the molds.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with coconut chutney and sambar.</li>
