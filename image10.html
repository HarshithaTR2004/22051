        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>For Gulab Jamun:</li>
            <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>Milk (as needed to knead the dough)</li>
            
            <li>For Sugar Syrup:</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>A few saffron strands (optional)</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Sugar Syrup:</li>
            <p>In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Bring it to a boil, and then simmer for a few minutes until the syrup slightly thickens. Add saffron strands and cardamom powder. Remove from heat and keep it warm.</p>
            
            <li>Prepare the Gulab Jamun Dough:</li>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda. Add ghee and mix well. Gradually add milk and knead to form a soft and smooth dough.</p>
            
            <li>Shape and Fry the Gulab Jamun:</li>
            <p>Take small portions of the dough and shape them into small, smooth balls. Ensure there are no cracks.</p>
            <p>Heat oil or ghee in a pan for frying. The oil should be medium hot.</p>
            <p>Fry the shaped dough balls until they turn golden brown, then remove and drain on paper towels.</p>
            
            <li>Soak in Sugar Syrup:</li>
            <p>Place the fried Gulab Jamun in the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for at least 2 hours to absorb the flavor and become soft.</p>
            
            <li>Serve Gulab Jamun:</li>
            <p>Garnish with additional saffron strands, if desired, and serve the Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature.</p>
