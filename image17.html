        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pieces of white fish fillets (e.g., cod or haddock)</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by preparing the fish fillets. Pat them dry with paper towels and season with salt, black pepper, and paprika.</li>
            <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow bowls. One with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Dip each fish fillet into the flour, making sure it's coated evenly. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
            <li>Next, dip the fillet into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off.</li>
            <li>Finally, coat the fillet with breadcrumbs, pressing the breadcrumbs onto the fish to adhere. Repeat for all fillets.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Carefully add the breaded fish fillets and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Remove the fish fingers from the skillet and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with lemon wedges and your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>
