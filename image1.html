        <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Poori" width="400" height="400">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
            <li>Water (as needed)</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            Prepare the Dough:<br><br>
            
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour, salt, sugar, and 1 tablespoon of oil.</li>
           <li> Gradually add water while kneading to form a smooth, firm, and non-sticky dough. The dough should be slightly stiff.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
            Divide the Dough:<br><br>
            
           <li> After resting, divide the dough into small lemon-sized balls. You can make around 10-12 balls from this dough.</li>
            Roll the Dough:<br><br>
            
            <li>Take one dough ball and roll it between your palms to make a smooth ball.</li>
            <li>Flatten the ball slightly.</li>
            Roll Out the Poori:<br><br>
            
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Take a dough ball and roll it out into a thin, circular disc using a rolling pin. It should be about 4-5 inches in diameter. Make sure the edges are thinner than the center; this helps the poori puff up while frying.</li>
            Fry the Poori:<br><br>
            
            <li>To check if the oil is hot enough for frying, drop a small piece of dough into the oil. If it sizzles and rises to the top, the oil is ready.</li>
            <li>Gently slide the rolled poori into the hot oil. It should puff up within a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to gently press the poori down, helping it puff up evenly.</li>
            <li>Fry the poori until it turns golden brown, then flip it to the other side and fry until both sides are evenly cooked.</li>
            Remove and Drain:<br><br>
            
            <li>Once the poori is golden brown and crispy, remove it from the oil using a slotted spoon.</li>
            <li>Place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
            Repeat:<br><br>
            
           <li> Follow the same process for the remaining dough balls.</li>         
            
            
            Serve hot pooris with your favorite side dishes such as potato masala, chana masala, or any other curry of your choice.<br>
