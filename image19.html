        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10-12 chicken lollipops</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by preparing the chicken lollipops. Pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken lollipops with salt, black pepper, and paprika.</li>
            <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow bowls. One with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Dip each chicken lollipop into the flour, making sure it's coated evenly. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
            <li>Next, dip the lollipop into the beaten eggs, allowing any excess to drip off.</li>
            <li>Finally, coat the lollipop with breadcrumbs, pressing the breadcrumbs onto the chicken to adhere. Repeat for all lollipops.</li>
            <li>In a deep fryer or a large pot, heat vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C). Carefully add the breaded chicken lollipops and fry for about 6-8 minutes, or until they are golden brown and fully cooked inside.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken lollipops from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with lemon wedges and your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
        </ol>
