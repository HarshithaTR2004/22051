        <img src="image11.jpg" alt="Payasam" width="400" height="400">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup rice</li>
            <li>1 liter full-fat milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cashews and raisins</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
            <p>Wash the rice and cook it until soft. You can pressure cook it with 2-3 whistles or cook it in a pan with water. Drain the water and keep the cooked rice aside.</p>
            
            <li>Prepare the Milk Base:</li>
            <p>In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, bring the milk to a boil. Stir it continuously to avoid sticking to the bottom of the pan.</p>
            
            <li>Add Cooked Rice:</li>
            <p>Once the milk begins to boil, add the cooked rice and continue to simmer on low heat. Stir occasionally.</p>
            
            <li>Add Sugar:</li>
            <p>When the rice is soft and the kheer thickens, add sugar and stir well. Continue to simmer and stir until the sugar dissolves.</p>
            
            <li>Fry Cashews and Raisins:</li>
            <p>In a separate pan, heat some ghee and fry cashews and raisins until they turn golden. Add them to the kheer.</p>
            
            <li>Add Cardamom and Saffron:</li>
            <p>Add cardamom powder and saffron strands (if using). Stir well.</p>
            
            <li>Simmer and Serve:</li>
            <p>Continue to simmer until the kheer reaches your desired consistency. It thickens as it cools, so adjust accordingly.</p>
            <p>Serve the payasam warm or chilled, garnished with more saffron and nuts, if desired.</p>
