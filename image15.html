        <img src="image15.jpeg" alt="Parotta" width="400" height="400">
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Water (as needed)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour and salt. Add vegetable oil and mix well. Gradually add water while kneading to form a soft and smooth dough. Cover and let it rest for about 20-30 minutes.</p>
            
            <li>Divide the Dough:</li>
            <p>After resting, divide the dough into equal-sized portions and roll them into small balls.</p>
            
            <li>Roll Out the Parotta:</li>
            <p>Take one dough ball and roll it out into a thin, flat disc on a clean surface. Brush the surface with ghee and sprinkle a little more flour over it.</p>
            <p>Now, start folding the disc into pleats, similar to a paper fan, until you have a long strip of pleated dough.</p>
            <p>Roll the pleated strip into a spiral, tucking the end underneath to secure it. This creates a layered parotta.</p>
            
            <li>Cook the Parotta:</li>
            <p>Heat a griddle or tava over medium heat. Place the rolled parotta on the griddle and cook until it turns golden brown on one side.</p>
            <p>Flip the parotta and cook the other side until it's also golden brown. Apply a little ghee while cooking if desired.</p>
            
            <li>Serve Parotta:</li>
            <p>Serve the hot, flaky parotta with your choice of side dishes, such as curry, chutney, or yogurt.</p>
